	I don't know what you've been told
	But time is running out, no need to take it slow
	I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
	I should be scared, honey, maybe so
	But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
	Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
	I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
	Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below
	I ain't worried 'bout it
	I ain't worried 'bout it
	I don't know what you've been told
	But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
	I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
	Got no regrets even when I'm broke (yeah)
	I'm at my best when I got somethin' I'm wanting to steal
	Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel, yeah-yeah
	No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
	I'll take it in and let it go
	But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
	Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
	I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
	Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below
	I ain't worried 'bout it
	I ain't worried 'bout it
	Ooh-ooh-ohh, ooh (I ain't worried)
	Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (oh, no, no)
	I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
	Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
	I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
	Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below
	I ain't worried 'bout it
	I ain't worried 'bout it
	I ain't worried 'bout it
